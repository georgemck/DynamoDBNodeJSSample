# DynamoDBNodeJSSample

This application inserts data into DynamaDB using NodeJS. It requires the AWS CLI to be configured. There are two examples one using data from Apple and the other from Amazon.

This programs loads a data source from a local JSON file. The standard JSON filed is transformed into DynamoDB JSON before insertion. This is done automatically by the AWS SDK. Base code was generated from AWS's NoSQL Workbench for DynamoDB.

The music data file selena.json came from the Apple Music service. The bin data json for the images came from Amazon.
