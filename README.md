# DynamoDBNodeJSSample

This application inserts data into DynamaDB using NodeJS. It requires the AWS CLI to be configured. 

It loads a data source from a local JSON file. The standard JSON filed is transformed into DynamoDB JSON before insertion. There are two npm packages used to do that and they are listed in the package.json. Base code was generated from AWS's NoSQL Workbench for DynamoDB.

The music data file selena.json  came from the Apple Music service.
